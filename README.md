# Apollo GraphQL todo app

👷🏽‍♂️Work in progress!

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mattrothenberg/status/1219623191712272384), this is a todo app based on Apollo GraphQL. It captures the way I like to use the GraphQL stack and will serve as a reference for me for the future (in case I spend the next year working on a Redux app!).

I'll probably build others eventually, but starting with Apollo GraphQL as it's my favourite stack at present.

## Run 🏃🏽‍♀️

This repo uses Yarn Workspaces and is set up so that the following should get things running:

```
$ yarn && yarn start
```


## Work In Progress 👷🏽‍♂
I'll update this README with more info as I progress.

## Tech
* Apollo Server & Apollo Client
* Prettier / pretty-quick / husky
* GraphQL Codegen
* TypeScript
* React / react-scripts
